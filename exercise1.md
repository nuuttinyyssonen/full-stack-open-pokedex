In CI it's important to take care of linting, testing and building carefully. Let's say that I my choice for programming language is Javascript. It's an obvious choice cause it's been used so much in this course and in general web development. 

For linting propably one of the most common choices would be eslint. Eslint and linting in general makes sure that the coding style is bascially the same for everyone so it's much easier for each developer in the project to read it. 

Testing in other hand is also important step in software development. What testing library I were to pick depends on if we are developing frontend or backend. For both we can use jest library which is very common and relatively easy to use testing library. How ever in front end there is library called Cypress. In my opinion it's very easy to use even compared to Jest and I would take advantage of that every time I could.

In building as well there are many tools we can use in software development but the ones I would consider using are propably Jenkins and GitHub Actions. Jenkins for example is open-source automation server that support building and deploying. 

If for some reason we don't want to use Github Actions or Jenkins then some of the alterantives would be TeamCity, AWS CodePipelin, Bamboo and Gitlab CI.

Wether we want to use self-Hosted or cloud-hosted environment it really depends on the project. Cloud-hosted environment has smaller costs in genreal compared to self-hosted but for example the control is more limited compared to self-hosted. If this project that I would be working on is solo project then I would likely choose cloud-hosted environment.
